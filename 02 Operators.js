// 1. Multiply 10 with 5, and alert the result:

// 3. Alert the remainder when 15 is divided by 9 (modulus).

// 4. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 15 (same as x = x + y).

// 5. Use the correct assignment operator that will result in x being 50 (same as x = x * y).
